PullToRefreshLayout for Xamarin.Forms
===================================

Implementation of pull to refresh layout for Xamarin.Forms targeting iOS and Android.

The goal was to create a cross-platform Xamarin.Forms Layout that could have it’s content set to anything and would enable pull to refresh capabilities. 

A BIG thank you to [Jason Smith](https://twitter.com/jassmith87) for his assistance on some tricky logic.

For a detailed overview of the API and sample please read through my blog:

Also available as a NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Refractored.XamForms.PullToRefresh/

Build Status: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6ivxyyj05tabo40a/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JamesMontemagno/xamarin-forms-pulltorefreshlayout/branch/master)

**Important**

If you are using the NuGet ensure that you call “PullToRefreshLayoutRenderer.Init();” in both your MainActivity and AppDelegate. (Similar to Xamarin.Forms.Maps).


Android: You must build and compile against SDK 8.1+ as this uses Android Support 27.0.2!

### API
Simply create a PullToRefreshLayout like any other Layout and set the Content to a supported view.


```csharp
var scrollView = new ScrollView
{
  VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.FillAndExpand,
  HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.FillAndExpand,
  Content = /* Anything you want in your ScrollView */
};

var refreshView = new PullToRefreshLayout {
                VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.FillAndExpand,
                HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.FillAndExpand,
                Content = scrollView,
                RefreshColor = Color.FromHex("#3498db")
            };

//Set Bindings
refreshView.SetBinding<TestViewModel> (PullToRefreshLayout.IsRefreshingProperty, vm => vm.IsBusy, BindingMode.OneWay);
refreshView.SetBinding<TestViewModel>(PullToRefreshLayout.RefreshCommandProperty, vm => vm.RefreshCommand);

Content = refreshView;
```

Additionally, your content could be anything you want including a StackLayout:

```csharp
Content = new StackLayout
{
  Children = 
  {
    new Label { Text = “Hello Pull to Refresh“ },
    refreshView
  }
};
```

You can of course do it in XAML:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ContentPage 
    xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms" 
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml" 
    x:Class="RefreshSample.Views.ScrollViewXamlPage"
    xmlns:controls="clr-namespace:Refractored.XamForms.PullToRefresh;assembly=Refractored.XamForms.PullToRefresh"
    Title="Xaml Scroll">
   <controls:PullToRefreshLayout
          IsPullToRefreshEnabled="True"
          RefreshCommand="{Binding RefreshCommand}"
          IsRefreshing="{Binding IsBusy}"
          RefreshColor="Blue"> 
          <ScrollView
          HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand"
          VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand">
            <StackLayout
                  HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand"
                  VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand">
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Blue"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Red"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Yellow"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Purple"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Maroon"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Blue"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Red"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Yellow"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Purple"/>
                <BoxView HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" BackgroundColor="Maroon"/>
            </StackLayout>
          </ScrollView>
   </controls:PullToRefreshLayout>
</ContentPage>

```

### Officially Supported Views:
* ListView
* ScrollView

### Unofficial Supported Views
* UICollectionView (iOS)

* Potentially all Android Views without a scroll, but it acts a bit odd on some
* ^^You should probably use a ScrollView^^
